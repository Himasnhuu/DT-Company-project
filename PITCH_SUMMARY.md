# 60-Second Verbal Pitch Summary
## DT Fellowship - CRM Data Champion

**[30 seconds - Problem & Solution]**

"Traditional CRMs force leads through rigid funnels, wasting resources on low-intent prospects while high-intent buyers get lost in generic sequences. I built CRM Data Champion to solve this with intent-driven segmentation—the system automatically routes leads based on behavioral signals, not arbitrary stages.

High-intent leads showing pricing page visits and demo requests get founder-level attention within 24 hours. Mid-intent prospects enter educational nurturing. Low-intent leads receive long-term relationship building. This isn't just automation—it's strategic resource allocation.

**[20 seconds - Business Impact]**

The analytics dashboard shows real impact: 7:1 LTV to CAC ratio, channel-specific ROI tracking, and funnel optimization insights that turn data into decisions. I used AI for content generation and behavioral analysis, but preserved human judgment for execution timing.

**[10 seconds - Builder Mindset]**

This represents how I think as a builder—data systems provide intelligence, humans execute strategy. The result is a CRM that scales intuition rather than replacing it, turning customer lifecycle management into competitive advantage through strategic storytelling and behavioral intelligence.

Built for scale, designed for humans."
